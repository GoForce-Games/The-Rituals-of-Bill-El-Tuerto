## 🛠️ Development Process

**"The Rituals of Bill ‘El Tuerto’"** has been developed using **Unity** as the main game engine, leveraging the **OpenXR plugin** to ensure cross-device compatibility, native performance, and access to advanced VR features on Meta Quest 3.

From the beginning, the project was conceived as a psychological horror built specifically for virtual reality, where immersion, discomfort, and narrative pacing are central to the experience. Our goal has always been to blur the line between puzzle solving and storytelling, building tension through interaction rather than jump scares.

### 🔧 Technology Stack

* **Unity Engine (2022+)** for core development
* **OpenXR Toolkit** for VR interaction and headset compatibility
* **XR Interaction Toolkit** for object interaction, physics-based grabbing, and raycasting
* **C# Scripting** for gameplay logic, puzzle control, timer systems, fail triggers, and UI transitions

### 🧐 Design Philosophy

* Every room is built with **spatial storytelling** in mind. Clues and objects are intentionally placed to make the player look, move, and interact naturally.
* **Puzzle logic** is state-driven, using scriptable objects and event listeners to ensure modularity and reusability across scenes.
* The **player experience is dynamic**: with both standing and seated modes available, all interactions are mapped for comfort and accessibility.
* Development has been iterative: each room was prototyped individually, tested in isolation, and later stitched into a seamless gameplay flow.

### ⚖️ Additional Systems

* Custom time management system to enforce the 30-minute fail state.
* Seamless switching between **teleportation** and **smooth locomotion**, with in-game toggles.
* Integrated **checkpoint loader** for rapid debugging and QA testing during development.
* UI & system menus designed for VR controller input with ray pointer or direct hand interaction.
